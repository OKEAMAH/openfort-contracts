# Recoverable Accounts
Recoverable accounts are a special type of accounts that let owners define a set of guardians to help recover the account in case the private key of the owner is compromised (forgotten, disclosed, stolen...).

## Context 

As explained by Vitalik in a famous post (https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), guardians are the next thing after multisig wallets.

Observe the image below from the mentioned blog post to visualize how guardians work.
